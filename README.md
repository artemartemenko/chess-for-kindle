# Chess for Kindle

A simple chess game for **two people on one Kindle**.

For quiet evenings at home, slow mornings in a cafe, park, or long trips where you just want something simple and real.
No accounts. No AI. No distractions.  
Just chess.

## Why this exists

eReader screens feel close to paper.  
This project turns your Kindle into a minimal, paper-like chessboard you can share with another person.

Just sit opposite each other and play.


## Features

- **Made for E-Ink:** High contrast, no animations, no flicker.
- **Two humans, one device:** The board rotates automatically for face-to-face play.
- **Lightweight:** Loads fast, drains almost no battery.


## How to Play

1. Open https://artemartemenko.github.io/chess-for-kindle/ or https://is.gd/chesskindle in the Kindle Web Browser.
2. Sit opposite each other.
3. Make the first move.

Settings: Double-tap empty square to **lock** piece rotation.

Tip: Bookmark the game page so you don't lose it. If you don't open other websites, the game will even launch automatically when you open your browser.
