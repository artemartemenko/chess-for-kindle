# Chess for Kindle

A simple chess game for **two people on one Kindle**.

For quiet evenings at home, slow mornings in a cafe, park, or long trips where you just want something simple and real.
No accounts. No AI. No distractions.  
Just chess.

## Why this exists

eReader screens feel close to paper.  
This project turns your Kindle into a minimal, paper-like chessboard you can share with another person.

No menus to learn. No settings to tweak.  
Just sit opposite each other and play.
