# Chess for Kindle

A simple chess game for **two people on one Kindle**. Turn your eReader into a minimal, paper-like chessboard you can share with another person. For quiet evenings at home, slow mornings in a cafe, a park, or long trips where you just want something simple and real.

No accounts. No AI. No distractions. Just chess.

## Features

- **Made for E-Ink:** High contrast, no animations, no flicker.
- **Lightweight:** Loads fast, drains almost no battery.
- **Offline mode**: The game works without an internet connection! However, it’s recommended to connect occasionally and refresh the page to get the latest updates.
- **Game persistence:** The chess game can be resumed after closing the browser or reloading the page.
- **Two humans, one device:** The board rotates automatically for face-to-face play, or use a double-tap on an empty square to keep your opponent’s pieces flipped.
